# FixIt Live Services

This is a publishable FixIt website with a Node.js backend API, a polished customer frontend, a separate customer panel, a private admin panel, UPI booking, and Razorpay Checkout support.

## Run locally

```powershell
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Private admin API

Set a secret key before publishing:

```powershell
$env:FIXIT_API_KEY="your-strong-secret"
npm start
```

Use the same key in the app's Admin screen to view private bookings, add workers, or delete workers.

## Optional payment settings

```powershell
$env:FIXIT_UPI_ID="test@razorpay"
$env:FIXIT_MERCHANT_NAME="FixIt"
$env:FIXIT_API_KEY="12345"
npm start

```

## Razorpay setup

Create API keys in your Razorpay Dashboard and set them before starting the server:

```powershell
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: rzp_test_SvX1dYtW9En9hP
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: Nx6tZRG7L9mG1MHOh6JiH1CL
npm start
```

Razorpay payments use the standard Checkout flow:

1. The server creates a Razorpay order.
2. The customer pays in Razorpay Checkout.
3. The server verifies the returned signature.
4. The booking is saved only after successful verification.

If Razorpay keys are not configured, the Razorpay button is disabled and UPI/cash booking still works.

## Publish

Upload this folder to a Node host such as Render, Railway, Fly.io, or any VPS.
